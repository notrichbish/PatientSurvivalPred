# PatientSurvivalPred
This project was one of the requirements within my postgraduate module called Data Mining. The domain that i have chosen is the healthcare domain in predicting the survivability of the patient based on APACHE II and APACHE III score. A dataset description can be founded in the github file as well. Generally, the main process flow of this project is performing Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, and Model Training. The models that are chosen are Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.

The project is coded in R Programming Language using R Studio IDE.

The dataset is too huge to be uploaded to GitHub. Therefore, here is the link to the dataset on Kaggle:
